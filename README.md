# The Artificial Language ToolKit (ALTK)

## Introduction

ALTK is a toolikt that aims to allow researchers to do "Unnatural Language Semantics" -- a style of research in linguistic semantics that tries to describe and explain natural languages by contrasting them with artificial (mathematically possible) ones. A particular focus is on _efficient communication_: determining whether particular (especially semantic) domains are optimized for a trade-off between cognitive complexity and communicative precision.

Key features:

- feature 1
- feature 2
- feature 3

## List of implemented analyses

List of reproduced experiments from published work:

- modals
- quantifiers
- color terms

## Installing ALTK

1. Create a fresh conda environment with Python 3.6 or newer

2. Install via pip

3. Run an experiment, e.g. an efficient communication analysis of natural language modals

## ALTK structure

The repo is organized as follows:

```md
src
└── altk
    ├── effcomm # efficient communication module
    └── language # general artificial language module
```

## How-to-start

- Some resources for an introduction to efficient communication.
- A jupyter/colab tutorial for ALTK.
- Original code for experiments reproduced with ALTK.

Do you have a phenomena of interest in linguistic semantics that you want to run an efficient communication analysis on? ALTK is designed to lower the barrier to entry for such research and unify methodologies, so if you find something confusing or would like to collaborate, please open an issue or start contributing!

### TODO

For now, ALTK is focused on providing a unified library for efficient communication analyses of natural language semantic domains. Future work may extend the library to:

- analyses of linguistic domains in terms of ease of learnability
- generating artificial data for NLP experiments
- constructing languages for psycholinguistics research
